This project Adds a little quantity of functions for lua, notice that this project is a test, nothing especial, just for me test my lua skills.

Im that README file i will teach you how to use every function of that package/project and how to install it

--Installation

when installed, copy or move de archive to your vs code project folder

--how to use

when installed, in the archive of your choice, type:

local plusfunctions = require("PlusFunctionsLua.lua")

this will add every function to your archive so you can use it properly

--How To Use sum()

sum needs two input arguments, sum() will sum these two. Ex:

number1 = 10
number2 = 7
sum(number1, number2) -- the function will sum the two input arguments

--How To Use sum_self()

sum_self() needs only one input argument and it will sum him with himself. Ex:

sum_self(number1) -- output: 20

--How To Use subtract()

same thing of sum() function, need two input arguments and subtract the two numbers

subtract(number1, number2)

--How To Use multiplicate()

i think i even need to tell what multiplicate() does, anyways it needs two input arguments

multiplicate(number1, number2)

--How To Use divide()

samething og multiplicate(), need two input arguments and return de division of the two numbers

divide(number1, number2)

--How To Use rest_of_division()

it shows the rest of division, need two input arguments

rest_of_division(number1, number2)

--How to Use integer_division()

it makes a integer division, need two input arguments

integer_division(number1, number2)

--How To Use len()

len() is a python like len function, it shows the quantity of letters a string has

len("potato")

--How To Use cus_type()

like len() its a python line function, shows the type similar how python does

cus_type(4)

--How To Use isnum()

isnum() verifies the value, if it is a number, then "true" you be showed, if not then "false" you be showed

isnum("potato")

--How To Use isstring()

isstring() do the same thing as isnum() but with strings

isstring(4)

Thats it, hope this helps!!
